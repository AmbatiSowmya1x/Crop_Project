# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Recommendation and Yield Prediction System

This project provides a web-based interface for recommending suitable crops and predicting expected yields based on soil and weather inputs.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Crop Recommendation**: Recommends suitable crops based on soil properties (Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphorus, pH) and weather conditions (Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall).
- **Yield Prediction**: Predicts the crop yield based on soil and weather inputs.
- **Django-based Interface**: User-friendly web interface for inputting data and displaying results.
- **Machine Learning Models**: 
  - Crop Recommendation: NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost
  - Yield Prediction: Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, SVR, KNN Regressor
